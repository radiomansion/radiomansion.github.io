<h1>Radio Mansion began on May 7 as a seven-week collective experiment to build a 24-hour internet radio at Mansion in Beirut. The radio space quickly grew into a community outlet, which brought together a plethora of voices, including underrepresented and marginalized groups, to imagine, produce, and transmit new narratives about who they are, where they are, and where they’d like to go.
In seven weeks the project succeeded in reaching out to and engaging with more than 100 people and community groups, including residents and users of Mansion, social workers, migrant domestic workers, operators of a suicide hotline, people who identify as LGBT, anthropologists, oral historians, teachers, students, poets, comedians, musicians, and artists from Lebanon and the wider region.

We are releasing 24 hours of content — including 13 new shows and radio content — over 7 days, on air and at Mansion, starting June 23 and ending June 29. Tune in or swing by (or both).
