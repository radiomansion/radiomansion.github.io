<h1>Radio Mansion</h1>
<p>Radio Mansion is a 7-week collective experiment to build a 24-hour internet radio at Mansion in Beirut. The radio space is meant to act as a community outlet, bringing together a myriad of voices, including underrepresented and marginalized groups, to imagine, produce, and transmit new narratives about who they are, where they are, and where theyâ€™d like to go. The project has succeeded, in a span of 7 weeks, in engaging more than 100 people and community groups, including underage boys who were in prison, migrant domestic workers, operators of a suicide hotline, people who identify as LGBT, anthropologists, students, poets, musicians, and artists from Lebanon and the wider region. Radio Mansion is a collaboration between The Outpost and Mansion.</p>
