<h1>Radio Mansion began on May 7 as a seven-week collective experiment to build a 24-hour internet radio at Mansion in Beirut. The radio space quickly grew into a community outlet, which brought together a plethora of voices, including underrepresented and marginalized groups, to imagine, produce, and transmit new narratives about who they are, where they are, and where they’d like to go.
In seven weeks the project succeeded in reaching out to and engaging with more than 100 people and community groups, including residents and users of Mansion, social workers, migrant domestic workers, operators of a suicide hotline, people who identify as LGBT, anthropologists, oral historians, teachers, students, poets, comedians, musicians, and artists from Lebanon and the wider region.
</br>
</br>
We are releasing 24 hours of content — including 13 new shows and radio content — over 7 days, on air and at Mansion, starting June 23 and ending June 29. Tune in or swing by (or both).

<h4>ON AIR</h4>
</br>
<h4>I See the Sea</h4>
<p>We commissioned young poets to write poetry that begins with “I see the sea”, inspired by the view from Mansion’s rooftop, where you could still see the sea if you squeezed yourself tightly in one corner. That little strip of blue we seek and sometimes still see from Beirut’s balconies and rooftops represents the hope that keeps us moving forward in this city. Recorded at Open Mic: Poetry for Everybody x Radio Mansion.
